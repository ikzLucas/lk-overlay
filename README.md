# lk-overlay ebuild Repository

My personal Gentoo ebuild overlay

Packages will be masked with unstable keyword (~)

New ebuilds will appear in staging, production-ready ebuilds in master

**Enable with eselect-repository:**
```
eselect repository add lk-overlay git https://github.com/LukeTgz/lk-overlay
```

# Note on Hyprland ebuilds:

these ebuilds are simply bumped versions from the official ::gentoo tree- they will be available when newer versions are available and not yet present in the main tree- official Gentoo ebuilds should always be preferred
